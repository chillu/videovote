# A Simple Video Voting App

This app allows users to suggest videos by pasting in their URLs.
The application will automatically retrieve and list details on the video
via the oEmbed protocol. By authenticating via Github, users can also vote on videos.

The use case for this app is company-internal "lunch and learn" sessions,
where a group of devs get together to watch interesting conference talks.

## Installation

The app requires the [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com/) framework. Install it with:

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Then navigate to the application folder and run it:

```
meteor --settings settings.json
```

## Configuration

Create a `settings.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "public": {
    "github": {
      "clientId": ""
    }
  },
  "github": {
    "secret": ""
  }
}
```

Create a new [Github Developer Application](https://github.com/settings/developers)
and fill in the `clientId` and `secret` values. Use the base URL of your application
as the callback URL.
